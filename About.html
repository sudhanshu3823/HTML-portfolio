 <article>   
    Hi! I'm Sudhanshu Kumar, a creative individual with a passion for both the arts and technology. I love expressing myself through drawing and art & craft, and I’m equally enthusiastic about web development, where I get to bring ideas to life in the digital space.

Currently, I’m pursuing my BBA degree at the Central University of Andhra Pradesh. I come from the culturally rich state of Bihar, India, and I’m always eager to learn, create, and explore new opportunities in the world of technology and design.
