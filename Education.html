  <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree at the Central University of Andhra Pradesh. This program has given me a deep understanding of various business disciplines, such as finance, marketing, management, and entrepreneurship. Through this, I have developed critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills.

    Before entering university, I completed my schooling at Loyola School, which provided me with a strong academic foundation. From 11th to 12th grade, I attended Golden Bell Public School, where I focused on building my knowledge in subjects that interested me and honed my passion for web development and creativity.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    These experiences have not only shaped my academic journey but also helped me grow personally, preparing me for the challenges and opportunities ahead in both my career and personal projects.
